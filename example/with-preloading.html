<p>This is an example <strong>without</strong> preloading.</p>
<p>All chunks will start loading at the moment they are requested, the log below will show how much time
    (in milliseconds) passed from the time the asset was requested till the time it was executed.</p>

<p>You could also slow down your network from the developer console to see a more noticeable difference.</p>

<button type="button" id="start">Start Test</button>&nbsp;
